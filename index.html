    <h1>Sustaining Life: Population Dynamics and Water Resources</h1>
    <h3>This visualization explores the relationship between population density, water production, and access to treated water across Malaysia, providing insights for policymakers and citizens. By comparing regional trends, it highlights disparities and supports data-driven decisions for sustainable water resource management.
    </h3>
    <div id="map-container">
        <div id="map-vis"></div>
        <p class="caption">Population density is a key measure that provides insights into how densely populated an area is. It is calculated by dividing the current population by the land mass area of the state. This measure helps to understand the pressure on resources such as clean water, housing, and infrastructure within each state.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="graph-container">
        <div id="vis"></div> 
        <p class="caption">Water production over time by state (in MLD). This graph helps us to understand the water supply across states and see the changes over the years. You can hover over to get more information.</p>

    <h2>Reason for Analysis</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on a project to improve
         the clean water system in Malaysia. 
         The primary goal is to determine which state we should focus on.
        By analyzing population density, water production, and
         water accessibility across various states,
          I aim to pinpoint regions where water systems are under pressure or
           where improvements are most needed.
            This insight will allow us to prioritize our efforts and resources more effectively.</p>
