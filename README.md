# Water Resource Management in Malaysia

## Domain, Why, and Who

The domain of this visualization is **water resource management** in Malaysia, focusing on the relationship between **population density, water production**, and **access to clean water**. With rising urbanization and population growth, areas with high population density face significant **water scarcity challenges**. 

This visualization helps to identify **regional disparities** in water access and production, providing insights for **policymakers, urban planners, and environmental agencies**. The target audience includes:
- **Government officials** working on water policies.
- **Urban planners** managing resources.
- **Malaysian citizens** concerned about sustainable water management.

## What

This visualization leverages data from several official sources:

- **Population data**: Provided by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), offering state-level population figures.
- **Water production data**: Obtained from state water agencies, showing water production (in MLD) across states over a 20-year period.
- **Access to treated water**: Derived from governmental reports, indicating the percentage of people in each state with access to clean, treated water.

These datasets are crucial for highlighting disparities between states in terms of water access and production. Data cleaning and formatting steps were taken to ensure accuracy and consistency across all datasets.

## How

This project uses several visual techniques to display the information effectively:

### Choropleth Map
- Visualizes **population density** by state, using color gradients to differentiate between regions with varying population densities.
- **Tooltips** provide additional details for each state, including the percentage of the population with access to treated water. This map serves as a quick reference for understanding regional water challenges.

### Line Charts
Two synchronized line charts are used for side-by-side comparison:
1. **Water Production Over Time (2000–2020)**: Displays water production trends in each state over time, helping to assess changes in water supply infrastructure.
2. **Access to Treated Water Over Time**: Shows the percentage of the population with access to treated water over the same period. Comparing this data with water production highlights **discrepancies** between water supply and actual access, pinpointing states where efforts may be lagging.

These charts effectively visualize trends over time, allowing users to observe the changes in water production and access, and identify any existing gaps.

## Special Features

- **Minimalist Design**: The clean and streamlined layout ensures that only the most relevant information is displayed, avoiding visual clutter. This makes it easy for users to focus on the key insights—such as the relationship between water production and access—across different states.
  
- **Interactive Tooltips**: By hovering over different parts of the visual, users can access detailed information about specific states without overwhelming the interface.

- **Color Palette**: Carefully selected to distinguish between regions, the color palette enhances the visual clarity of trends and disparities between states.

Together, these design elements ensure that the visualization delivers **clear, meaningful insights** into Malaysia’s water resource management, guiding stakeholders toward more effective decision-making.
